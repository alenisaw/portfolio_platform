Installation and Setup:

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the project repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd portfolio_platform

2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using npm:
npm install

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:

env
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/portfolio_platform
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
MONGODB_URI — MongoDB connection string (use the default if running MongoDB locally).
EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS — Your email account credentials for sending emails.
Note: If using Gmail with two-factor authentication, create an "App Password" and use it instead of your regular password.

4. Run MongoDB
If MongoDB is not installed, download and install it from the official MongoDB website and start the local server:
mongod

5. Start the Application
Now, you can start the server:
npm start

By default, the server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

6. Database Structure
User Model
The user model stores information about the user, including:

email — required, unique email address for each user.
username — user's username.
password — hashed password.
firstName, lastName — first and last name of the user.
age — user's age.
gender — user's gender.
role — user role (default is "user", "admin" for administrators).
Portfolio Model
The portfolio model contains projects for each user. Each project includes:

title — project title.
description — project description.
images — array of image paths.
user — reference to the user who owns the project.


API Endpoints

Registration and Authentication
POST /register — User registration.
Required fields: email, username, password, firstName, lastName, age, gender.
POST /login — User login.
Required fields: username, password.
POST /verify-2fa — Verify 2FA token.
Required field: token (generated by a 2FA app, e.g., Google Authenticator).

Admin Panel
GET /admin-dashboard — Accessible only to admins. Allows viewing and managing users' information.

Technologies Used
Node.js — Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express.js — Framework for building server applications.
MongoDB — Database for storing user and portfolio data.
Mongoose — ODM library for MongoDB.
Nodemailer — Library for sending emails.
Speakeasy — Library for implementing two-factor authentication (2FA).
Multer — Middleware for handling file uploads (images).
bcryptjs — Library for hashing passwords.

Notes
For two-factor authentication, use a mobile app that supports TOTP (e.g., Google Authenticator).
If using Gmail for sending emails, ensure you have set up "App Passwords" if using two-factor authentication.

Conclusion
This project provides full functionality for creating and managing user portfolios, with registration, login, and two-factor authentication. It also includes an admin panel for managing users and their content.
